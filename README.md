## Introduction
Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or its data until a ransom is paid. This project aims to detect such threats by:
- Analyzing system and file behavior patterns.
- Employing machine learning models to classify potential ransomware activities.
- Providing tools for visualization and analysis.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes key patterns in the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements and evaluates algorithms for ransomware detection.
- **Customizable Workflow:** Easily adaptable for different datasets and configurations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ransomware-detection
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed for running `.ipynb` files:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "ransomware detection.ipynb"
   ```
2. Load the dataset (`data_file.csv`) into the notebook for preprocessing and analysis.
3. Follow the workflow in the notebook to:
   - Explore the data.
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models.
   - Visualize results and insights.

## Dataset
The dataset (`data_file.csv`) contains features related to system behavior, such as:
- File access patterns.
- System call frequencies.
- Resource utilization metrics.

Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the notebook.
